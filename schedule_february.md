## Goals

* At the end of february my goal is to be able to do a wide pull-up body weight
* FInish with a body weight of 62kg
* Drink everyday 2000ml of pure water, using an app what notifies me when to drink

## Schedule

**For the exercises look at the exercise page**  
**Running is 5km**  
**Checked means you have to do it that day**

### Instructions

* Choose one exercise of each variation checked except for running
* Make a program where you use the exercises
  * The program should look like exercise 1 -> exercise 2 -> exercise 3 -> exercise 1 etc.
  * No rest between the exercises
* 12 reps of each exercise as heavy as possible to be able to do it 3 times

## Corrections

Instead of training the whole week need to rest 2 days a week, probably the sunday and the thursday
